# sales_database
A basic sales analysis by integrating SQL within Python to manage a small database and generate a visualization.

# Project: SQLite Database Analysis with Python ðŸ“Š

This repository contains the solution for a data analysis task demonstrating the connection between Python and a lightweight SQLite database to generate a basic sales summary and visualization.

# Project Summary

This project involves the full analytical workflow, starting with data access and concluding with visualization:

 1 - Database Creation & Access: Used Python's sqlite3 module to create and connect to a small database file (sales_data.db) containing sales data.

 2 - Data Analysis: Executed a single SQL query (using SUM() and GROUP BY) to aggregate the raw data and calculate the total Revenue and Quantity sold by product.

 3 - Visualization: Generated and saved a Matplotlib bar chart to visually represent the total revenue for each product.
